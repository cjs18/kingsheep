Kingsheep Agent Template

This template is provided for the course 'Practical Artificial Intelligence' of the University of Zürich. 

Please edit the following things before you upload your agent:
	- change the name of your file to '[uzhshortname]_A1.py', where [uzhshortname] needs to be your uzh shortname: done
	- change the name of the class to a name of your choosing : done
	- change the def 'get_class_name()' to return the new name of your class: done
	- change the init of your class:
		- self.name can be an (anonymous) name of your choosing: done
		- self.uzh_shortname needs to be your UZH shortname: done

The results and rankings of the agents will be published on OLAT using your 'name', not 'uzh_shortname', 
so they are anonymous (and your 'name' is expected to be funny, no pressure).
